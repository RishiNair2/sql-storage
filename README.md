Google Data Analytics Certification Case Study 2- BellaBeat

This is a collection of SQL queries that I used when completing the Google Capstone Project- Case Study 2. The database was a  database from Kaggle that used survey results from FitBit users. The goal was to identify where the company should target their fitness devices based on an external dataset of a company that was similar to theirs.
